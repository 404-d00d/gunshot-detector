This is a project for my Introduction to Machine Learning Class in May of 2025. The purpose of this project is to develop a gunshot detector on my own.

# HOW TO RUN THE PROJECT:

## TO CREATE THE DATA FOR THE MODEL:
### 1.
Download the dataset I used for the project from this link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/chrisfilo/urbansound8k/data?select=fold6. In addition download the respository as well. Make sure the folder for the data, the csv file for the dataset, and all the files from the repository are in the same directory. If needed, change the directory in the program files so it matches.

### 2.
Run the bat file provided to augment the audio files, modify the CSV file, and convert the data that will be used for the model.
