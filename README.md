This is a project for my Introduction to Machine Learning Class in May of 2025. The purpose of this project is to develop a gunshot detector on my own.

# HOW TO RUN THE PROJECT:

## TO CREATE THE DATA FOR THE MODEL:
### 1.
Download the dataset I used for the project from this link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/chrisfilo/urbansound8k/data?select=fold6. In addition download the respository as well. Make sure the folder for the data, and all the files from the repository are in the same directory. If needed, change the directory in the program files included in the repository so it matches.

### 1.1.
Download real world footage of audio to serve as real life testing data. You do not need to download the exact real world .wav files I used, but if you plan to change the wav files used for actual testing, then you need to change the .py files that have the names of the files in them. As with step 1, make sure the .wav files are in the same directory as the folder of training data and the repository files.

### 2.
Run the bat file provided to augment the audio files, modify the CSV file, and convert the training and real world data that will be used for the model.
